Hello, I’m Syd!

I’m an artist who dabbles in a little bit of everything! Whether it’s a painting to hang up in your home, fanart as a gift for a friend, or a website for myself, I love being able to express myself through a variety of media. 

I have an extensive background in traditional arts, which allows me to add a more hand-drawn touch to my digital work. I especially enjoy coding and creating assets by hand as it allows me to fully customize everything I make.

Much of my style is influenced by my experiences as an Asian American, with heavy inspiration from both Western and Asian media. I’m a storyteller at heart, and so most enjoy working on projects that allow for personality, be it from me or my clients. I believe art is best when it has a story to tell, and I’m so excited you’re taking the time to look at mine!

In my spare time, I like to bake sweets, read sci-fi, and make comics. Maybe someday I’ll share my comics and make comic creation part of my career. 

I am based in San Jose, California and hold a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) in Art, concentration in Pictorial Arts from San Jose State University.
