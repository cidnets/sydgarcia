If you’ve ever felt like the world is too big, too confusing or just downright overwhelming to tackle on your own, then this blog post is for you.

I know what it feels like when it seems like there are so many things in front of us that we can't do anything about because they're just too big. It's not true though!

Finding ways to be more savvy and less overwhelmed by our lives is actually really easy with these 61 tips that will make you a savvier traveler and give you some peace of mind at home.

Read on if travel has been on your mind lately but maybe you don't have the time or money to take a break from life right now – this post is perfect for all types of travelers!

### 1. Be prepared with a travel kit that includes necessities such as medications

Make sure to carry a travel kit with you when going on vacation. This will make it easy for you to stay healthy while away from home by including things like medicine and other items that are essential for your health.

Whether you're going for a week or two on vacation, or on a business trip, make sure to travel prepared. My travel kit always includes tons of medicine. I don't want to catch something while out on the road, so I'm prepared for anything!

It’s also a good idea to include emergency contact information into your travel kit.

### 2. Keep your passport handy at all times – don't put it in a safe or locker

Don't leave your passport in a safe.

I don't want to sound like your mother, but you should keep it with you at all times because if it's stolen then that could cause problems when going through security or leaving the country.

Always keep your passport in a place you can easily access it in case you need to make an emergency exit.

### 3. Update apps to your destination's currency to track your spending

You can track your spending more easily if you update the apps on your phone to the destination's currency. That way, it will be easier for you to check how much money you have left so that there are no surprises when it comes time to pay.

If you're traveling, it's a good idea to set your phone to the local currency so that all of your transactions are automatically labeled with their correct prices.

Fiddling around with exchange rates all the time is not worth it!

### 4. Book flights on Tuesdays and Wednesdays to get the cheapest fares

The best time to book a flight is on Tuesday or Wednesday. That's because most people are looking for flights over the weekend, so you can find some great deals if you have patience!

I first learned this trick from my flight attendant friends – and I can now confirm it works amazingly well! I’ve saved thousands of dollars by simply following this one travel hack.

### 5. Use Google Maps offline so you can still navigate even without a connection 

If you're driving or walking between places and don't have a data connection, use Google Maps' offline mode. It'll still give you directions and useful information like the distance to your destination, what streets to take, and how long it'll take to get there.

You can also download a map of your places of interest ahead of time, and then you get to use it anywhere – even on things like subways!

### 6. Carry a credit card from home country as well as one from destination country

If you are traveling to another country, it's always a good idea to bring your credit card from your home country with you. You don't want to rely on just one or two cards when travelling because that could be risky if one of them gets lost or stolen.

I always bring my credit card from home, as well as one from the place I'm going or alternatively an international card such as Revolut. In case anything happens, I always have a way to get money and communicate with people at home.

What are your own best travel hacks?

Traveling can be a stressful and terrifying experience, but it doesn’t have to be.

By following these simple tips, you will always know what to expect, where your passport is at all times, how much money you're spending on flights and accommodations (and when), and most importantly, that you are ready in case of emergency.
