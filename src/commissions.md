title: Commissions Terms & Conditions
description: Thank you for your support!

---

If you have a problem with any of these terms, they may be changed if discussed with me prior to paying for your commissioned piece.

Commissions can be purchased through [my Ko-Fi page here: https://ko-fi.com/cidnets](https://ko-fi.com/cidnets)

#### 1. General Terms 

- All drawings may or will include a subtle signature that you may not remove.
- All artworks and related works may be recorded and posted to my portfolio and social media. 
- Prices are subject to change based on demand.
- I have the right to reject any order that I do not feel comfortable drawing for any reason.

**Note:** Commissioned pieces are limited to my skills. I can draw fanart, original characters (OCs), and photo references. I cannot draw bara (intense muscles), mechas, or NSFW artworks.

#### 2. Payment

Payment will be paid through Ko-Fi or Etsy. I will not start the work until after payment has been received.

**NO FULL REFUNDS** after I have started working. A 50% Partial refund may be negotiated if I have not finished a rough draft/sketch. 

**NO REFUNDS AFTER DRAFTS/SKETCHES HAVE BEEN COMPLETED.** 

*See process and delivery for more information.*

#### 3. PROCESS AND DELIVERY

I will notify you when I have started on your commission and you, therefore, lose the rights to a **FULL** refund.

1. SKETCHING STAGE

   - While I'm working on your commission, I will send a work-in-progress (WIPs) of the sketch(es) to make sure it is right for you!
       - WIPs will include a watermark and be a smaller resolution compared to the finished piece.
   - If you do not like the sketch, you may request up to 2 revisions.
   - You must approve the sketch before I will continue working on the piece.

2. LINEART STAGE

   - Upon approval of the sketch, I will continue working on the lineart. 
   - I will send a WIP once the lineart is done, however, **no revisions may be made at this stage.** This is purely an update on my progress.

3. COLORING STAGE

   - Once the lineart is finished, I will continue into the coloring stage.
   - 1 revision is allowed at this stage to fix the colors.

4. FINAL DELIVERY

   - Once the piece is finished you will receive the full-resolution image along with a web-friendly size. 
   - **Note:** There is no physical product. Delivered product is fully digital.

5. DEADLINES 

   - The time it takes to finish your commission varies between 2 weeks-1 month depending on factors such as health, the complexity of the commissioned piece, and other work.
      - If anything comes up that will slow the progress of the initially estimated delivery time, I will let you know asap.
      
#### 4. REVISIONS


You get 3 revisions total included in the price of the commissioned piece.
   - 2 revisions allowed during the sketching stage in order to determine poses and composition
   - 1 revision allowed during the coloring stage in order to correct colors

**NOTE:** Once the sketch has been approved, **no revisions may be made to alter the pose or composition** of the piece. The final revision after the sketching stage is only to correct colors.

#### 5. COPYRIGHT / USAGE POLICY


I, Cidnets, claim the rights to the produced drawing, not the buyer. Therefore I am allowed to use the copyrighted artwork to: 

- Promote myself on any platform.
- Publish books with it (artbooks, etc.)
- Display it everywhere to my liking (portfolio, website, social media, etc.)
- Post it wherever I want

The buyer is allowed to:

- Use the commissioned piece for personal use unless agreed otherwise (you can upload it on all your social media profiles, forums, etc.)
- Print the artwork and claim the character(s) as their own, but not the artwork itself.
- Use the artwork to promote themselves. You are not forced to give me credit when you post it but it is very appreciated.
- Use the artwork on their Youtube channel and in monetized videos as long as the artwork itself is not the main subject for the earnings.

The following is considered copyright infringement:

- Reproducing/using the copyrighted artwork commercially - means making money off it in any way.
- Claiming the artwork as your own
- Removing my signature from the artwork
- Altering the artwork without my consent
    - I reserve the full rights to the image and its use/distribution unless otherwise agreed upon (rights to the image for your own non-personal use may be purchased at any time).

I own all rights to the work. Putting my work into any artificial intelligence (AI) engine is prohibited.

#### 6. Customer Satisfaction

I will do everything I can to make my customers happy!

If you have a problem with anything in regards to the commissioned piece, please tell me right away so we can find a solution together.

I am willing to change some of my terms for you if you ask before I start on your commission. If you, e.g., do not want me to post your art anywhere, we can discuss this.

#### 7. REFUND / CANCELLATION POLICY

The buyer is not allowed a refund once I start working on the commission.

If for any reason I am unable to start your commission you will receive a full refund.

If you cancel your order before I start it, you can get a full refund.

If you are getting a refund, do not request a Paypal chargeback. I will transfer the money back to you myself.
- If you request a Paypal chargeback at any point when you were not allowed to ask for a refund you will lose all aforementioned rights to the commissioned piece and I will have the full right to profit further from it in any way. I will decline the chargeback and supply Paypal with our conversations in which we talk about the commission as evidence that I have completed work for you. Furthermore, you will be blacklisted for commissioning me again.

If the buyer breaks any of the points stated above they will lose all aforementioned rights to the artwork commissioned by me, Cidnets, and I will have the right to profit further from the commissioned artwork in any way I see fit. If you have a problem with any of these statements, they may be changed if discussed with me prior to paying your commissioned piece.

#### What do you get?

- Sketch and/or final sketches that must be approved before I continue the work
- Insight and involvement in color plan (depending on the complexity of the commissioned piece)
- Full-resolution file at B4 paper size (approx. 257 x 353 mm at 350 DPI) of final drawing and a smaller version for internet upload. Final file formats are usually PNG.
